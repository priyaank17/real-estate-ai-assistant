St Regis The Residences at St. Regis Chicago Chicago st-regis-chicago 2021-10-15 The Residences at St. Regis Chicago: Jeanne Gang's Shimmering Gemstone Redefining Luxury Living Welcome to The Residences at St. Regis Chicago, where architectural innovation converges with legendary hospitality. Designed by internationally acclaimed architect Jeanne Gang of Studio Gang, this 101-story crystalline tower stands as Chicago's third-tallest building and the world's tallest structure designed by a woman-led team. Rising majestically from the prestigious Lakeshore East neighborhood, the building's three interconnected masses reach skyward at 47, 71, and 93 stories, creating a distinctive silhouette that recalls the brilliance of a multi-faceted gemstone catching light across the skyline.

This extraordinary development offers 393 uniquely crafted residences, ranging from sophisticated one-bedroom sanctuaries to expansive five-bedroom penthouses spanning up to 6,800 square feet. Each home showcases meticulous attention to detail, with interiors by world-renowned Hirsch Bedner Associates featuring gourmet kitchens by Snaidero USA with Gaggenau and Thermador appliances, spa-inspired bathrooms with Kallista fixtures, and color palettes inspired by precious stones, sapphire, amethyst, topaz, and fluorite. Residents enjoy the ultimate address where bespoke St. Regis service, a dedicated 47th-floor amenity level, and direct access to the five-star hotel create an uncompromising standard of luxury living. A Crystalline Vision: Where Architectural Poetry Meets the Chicago Sky Jeanne Gang's visionary design transforms the ordinary into the extraordinary, drawing inspiration from the natural brilliance of gemstones to create an architectural landmark that captures and refracts light across the Chicago skyline. The tower's form, a seemingly undulating crystalline façade, is achieved through an ingenious interplay of geometric frustums and six varying shades of blue-green glass, chosen to mirror the ever-changing moods of Lake Michigan. This is not simply a building; it is a living sculpture that breathes with the city, each angle revealing new facets, new perspectives, and new connections to the water and sky beyond.

The architectural philosophy extends beyond aesthetic beauty to embrace sustainability and innovation. More than 75% of construction materials were diverted back into manufacturing processes, while the structure's stepped profile and perimeter columns that move inward and outward create unique spaces within each residence—no two homes are identical. Gang's approach celebrates Chicago's rich architectural heritage while boldly advancing it into the future. Here, at the confluence of the Chicago River and Lake Michigan, residents inhabit spaces that feel simultaneously grounded in the natural world and elevated above it, where every window frames not just a view but a constantly evolving panorama of urban and natural grandeur.
