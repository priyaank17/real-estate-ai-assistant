St Regis The Residences at St. Regis Chicago Chicago st-regis-chicago 2021-10-15 The Residences at St. Regis Chicago: Jeanne Gang's Shimmering Gemstone Redefining Luxury Living Welcome to The Residences at St. Regis Chicago, where architectural innovation converges with legendary hospitality. Designed by internationally acclaimed architect Jeanne Gang of Studio Gang, this 101-story crystalline tower stands as Chicago's third-tallest building and the world's tallest structure designed by a woman-led team. Rising majestically from the prestigious Lakeshore East neighborhood, the building's three interconnected masses reach skyward at 47, 71, and 93 stories, creating a distinctive silhouette that recalls the brilliance of a multi-faceted gemstone catching light across the skyline.

This extraordinary development offers 393 uniquely crafted residences, ranging from sophisticated one-bedroom sanctuaries to expansive five-bedroom penthouses spanning up to 6,800 square feet. Each home showcases meticulous attention to detail, with interiors by world-renowned Hirsch Bedner Associates featuring gourmet kitchens by Snaidero USA with Gaggenau and Thermador appliances, spa-inspired bathrooms with Kallista fixtures, and color palettes inspired by precious stones, sapphire, amethyst, topaz, and fluorite. Residents enjoy the ultimate address where bespoke St. Regis service, a dedicated 47th-floor amenity level, and direct access to the five-star hotel create an uncompromising standard of luxury living. A Crystalline Vision: Where Architectural Poetry Meets the Chicago Sky Jeanne Gang's visionary design transforms the ordinary into the extraordinary, drawing inspiration from the natural brilliance of gemstones to create an architectural landmark that captures and refracts light across the Chicago skyline. The tower's form, a seemingly undulating crystalline façade, is achieved through an ingenious interplay of geometric frustums and six varying shades of blue-green glass, chosen to mirror the ever-changing moods of Lake Michigan. This is not simply a building; it is a living sculpture that breathes with the city, each angle revealing new facets, new perspectives, and new connections to the water and sky beyond.

The architectural philosophy extends beyond aesthetic beauty to embrace sustainability and innovation. More than 75% of construction materials were diverted back into manufacturing processes, while the structure's stepped profile and perimeter columns that move inward and outward create unique spaces within each residence—no two homes are identical. Gang's approach celebrates Chicago's rich architectural heritage while boldly advancing it into the future. Here, at the confluence of the Chicago River and Lake Michigan, residents inhabit spaces that feel simultaneously grounded in the natural world and elevated above it, where every window frames not just a view but a constantly evolving panorama of urban and natural grandeur.

Four Seasons Four Seasons Residences Tropicalia Dominican Republic four-seasons-tropicalia 2026-01-01 Four Seasons Residences Tropicalia: Where Sustainable Elegance Transforms the Dominican Republic's Southern Coast Four Seasons Private Residences Dominican Republic at Tropicalia represents a transformative vision for Caribbean luxury living. Positioned along the pristine southern coast of Samaná Bay, this exclusive enclave of just 25 private residences redefines what it means to find sanctuary in paradise. Developed by Cisneros Real Estate and bearing the legendary Four Seasons name, Tropicalia is conceived as more than a residence; it is a philosophy of living that honors simplicity, privacy, and environmental stewardship while delivering the world's most distinguished hospitality standards.

The development emerges from a landscape meticulously preserved for its biodiversity and historical significance. Every element has been thoughtfully designed to protect the diverse ecosystem of beaches, aquamarine waters, lush forests, and mangroves that make this corner of the Dominican Republic so exceptional. Tropicalia serves as a model for sustainable, low-density development, proving that luxury and environmental responsibility can exist in perfect harmony. Here, residents discover not just a home, but a lasting legacy—a place where memories transcend generations and where the profound connection to nature becomes part of daily life. Architecture That Breathes: Isay Weinfeld's Vision of Seamless Tropical Modernism Brazilian master architect Isay Weinfeld has created something extraordinary at Tropicalia, structures that transcend mere buildings to become experiences in themselves. His tropical modernist vision merges seamlessly with space and time, containing the anticipation of countless moments yet to unfold. These are not residences that simply look beautiful; they feel beautiful, awakening something deeper in the soul. Each design element draws inspiration from the island's native materials and colonial heritage, creating a timeless sophistication touched by tropical grace. The nonlinear format encourages continuous discovery, as buildings integrate with the lush landscape to immerse residents fully in nature's embrace.

Weinfeld's profound understanding of comfortable tropical living manifests in intimate details that capture attention without demanding it, flow-through interiors that welcome ocean breezes, spaces that shift gracefully from indoor to outdoor living, and materials that honor the earth from which they came. His low-impact approach respects the land's integrity while maximizing enjoyment and wonder. The architecture creates what Weinfeld calls ""structures merged with space and time,"" allowing life's most meaningful moments to unfurl gracefully and memorably. This is a design that doesn't impose itself upon nature but rather amplifies nature's inherent poetry, creating an ambiance where residents can truly find themselves again and again.

Since 1915, when visionary developer Nai Lert Sreshthaputra preserved this pristine tract of jungle as a private family sanctuary, the park has flourished into a serene city-center oasis. Today, under the stewardship of his great-granddaughter Naphaporn Bodiratnangkura, this living heart of Bangkok opens its canopy to a privileged few. Here, owners become part of Aman's distinguished global community while residing in spaces where every detail reflects the brand's Sanskrit-derived promise: peace. Available by invitation only, these residences offer not merely a home, but entry into a world where legacy meets luxury. A Sanctuary Suspended Between Canopy and Sky Jean-Michel Gathy's design philosophy for Aman Nai Lert Bangkok transcends conventional residential architecture, creating ethereal spaces that blur boundaries between interior and exterior, tradition and modernity. Each residence becomes a private pavilion floating above one of Bangkok's last urban jungles, where floor-to-ceiling windows dissolve walls into panoramas of emerald canopy and glittering cityscape. The architect has woven Thai cultural motifs into contemporary forms, honoring the site's century-old soul while embracing tomorrow's vision of urban living.

This is residential design as poetry, spaces that breathe with 3.2-meter ceilings and private terraces that extend living areas into the sky. Natural materials sourced from across continents complement bespoke furniture pieces, each surface and texture selected to create environments where residents experience the profound peace that defines the Aman way. Here, in this vertical sanctuary, luxury is measured not in ostentation but in space, silence, and the seamless integration of world-class service into daily life, creating homes that feel like personal retreats suspended between earth and heaven.

Residence ownership at Aman Nai Lert Bangkok unlocks a vertical sanctuary of world-class facilities designed exclusively for your wellbeing and pleasure.

The Nai Lert Group, founded in 1894 by Lert Sreshthaputra, Thailand's pioneering developer who revolutionized Thai life by introducing ice and establishing Bangkok's first five-star hotel, continues under the visionary leadership of his great-granddaughter, Naphaporn Bodiratnangkura. Her decision to open the family's cherished century-old sanctuary for this unprecedented collaboration speaks to both courage and vision.

Aman, drawing its name from the Sanskrit word for peace, has spent over three decades becoming the world's most intuitive luxury resort and residence brand since Amanpuri's 1988 founding in Phuket. Known for ultra-premium service, high-profile clientele, and the world's most exotic locations, Aman has transformed the definition of luxury living through properties that prioritize space, privacy, and a peerless home-away-from-home experience. Together, these two forces have created not simply residences, but a new chapter in Bangkok's architectural and cultural narrative, one where heritage preservation meets forward-thinking design, and where the peace of a century-old jungle sanctuary elevates urban living to an art form."

This extraordinary enclave of just thirty-two custom estate homes honors Muskoka's century-old cottage tradition while elevating it to unprecedented heights of sophistication and service.

Each residence is a meticulous interpretation of the traditional Canadian cabin, a harmonious blend of rustic authenticity and refined luxury. Designed by acclaimed Studio CABAN and appointed by Copenhagen's Norm Architects, these multi-acre estates feature expansive main residences, private boathouses, optional guest bunkies, and between 303 and 1,650 feet of coveted waterfront. With 40 acres preserved as conservation land and dedicated fish conservation waters, residents live in profound harmony with nature while enjoying legendary Ritz-Carlton service, arriving by private boat to a world where every detail is seamlessly managed. A Legacy Written in Water, Stone, and Sky; Where Time Moves Differently Imagine mornings where sunlight dances across your private dock, where the only sound is pine needles sighing in the breeze and loons calling across mirror-still waters. This is not a vacation home. This is where your family's story unfolds across generations, where children learn to paddle in protected coves, where friendships deepen around lakeside fires beneath canopies of stars, where the changing seasons become the rhythm of life itself.

Studio CABAN's architectural vision places each residence gently upon the land, following natural contours to maximize sun exposure and lake views while preserving absolute privacy. Stone and timber sourced from Canadian forests create structures that feel both ancient and contemporary, as if they've always belonged here. Inside, Norm Architects' Scandinavian sensibility brings warmth through natural materials, cathedral ceilings, and floor-to-ceiling windows that dissolve the boundary between shelter and wilderness.
